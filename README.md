   - Hellâ€™s Kitchen: ~34.02% of the period revenue (~$712K total across analyzed period).
   - Astoria: notable jump from ~$26K to ~$56K in June â€” likely seasonal demand or targeted promotions.

## Top actionable recommendations
1. Morning-focused promotions & staffing
   - Schedule peak staffing 7 AMâ€“10 AM to reduce wait times and increase throughput.
   - Launch breakfast combos (coffee + pastry) priced competitively for 7â€“10 AM.

2. Loyalty & retention
   - Implement a simple loyalty program (stamps or points) to increase repeat visits and average ticket size.
   - Offer bonus points for combo purchases to encourage bundling.

3. Upsell & bundling
   - Train POS prompts to suggest bundling (e.g., "Add a pastry for $X").
   - Introduce limited-time bundle discounts to test lift on premium items.

4. Reposition or trial premium items
   - Test smaller, trial-size offerings or sampling of loose teas and flavors.
   - Consider temporary discounts on premium inventory to increase trial and collect feedback.

5. Targeted promotions by store
   - Run A/B promotions in Astoria to learn what drove the June spike; replicate in other locations as appropriate.
   - Deploy geo-targeted offers for off-peak hours to smooth demand.

6. Inventory & procurement optimization
   - Use morning demand forecasts to adjust inventory (reduce waste, ensure availability of high-sellers).
   - De-prioritize slow-moving SKUs or test repositioning/price changes.

7. Measure & iterate
   - Track KPIs: daily revenue, avg. basket size, items per transaction, conversion rate for upsells, redemption rate for loyalty.
   - Run controlled experiments for offers and measure incremental revenue.

## Data (recommended files)
- data/Bright Coffee Shop Analysis - Transactions (1).csv â€” (transaction_id, store, datetime, product_id, product_name, qty, price, total)

---

## Methods & tools used / recommended
- Data wrangling and analysis: SQL
- BI & visualization: PowerBI, Google Looker Studio
- Spreadsheets: Excel (pivot analysis & quick-checks)

---

## Sample SQL queries (quick starters)

Top 10 products by revenue:
```sql
SELECT product_name, SUM(qty * price) AS revenue
FROM sales_transactions
GROUP BY product_name
ORDER BY revenue DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

Revenue by store and month:
```sql
SELECT store, DATE_TRUNC('month', datetime) AS month, SUM(qty * price) AS revenue
FROM sales_transactions
GROUP BY store, month
ORDER BY month, revenue DESC;
```

Peak hours (hour-of-day revenue):
```sql
SELECT EXTRACT(hour FROM datetime) AS hour, SUM(qty * price) AS revenue, COUNT(DISTINCT transaction_id) AS transactions
FROM sales_transactions
GROUP BY hour
ORDER BY revenue DESC;
```

Basket size distribution (items per transaction):
```sql
SELECT t.transaction_id, SUM(qty) AS items
FROM sales_transactions t
GROUP BY t.transaction_id;
-- then aggregate counts per items to see distribution
```

Revenue share by category (Coffee & Tea vs others):
```sql
SELECT category, SUM(qty * price) AS revenue, SUM(qty * price) / (SELECT SUM(qty * price) FROM sales_transactions) AS share
FROM sales_transactions s
JOIN products p ON s.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY revenue DESC;
```
