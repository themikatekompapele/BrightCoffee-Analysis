## Top actionable recommendations
1. Morning-focused promotions & staffing
   - Schedule peak staffing 7 AM–10 AM to reduce wait times and increase throughput.
   - Launch breakfast combos (coffee + pastry) priced competitively for 7–10 AM.

2. Loyalty & retention
   - Implement a simple loyalty program (stamps or points) to increase repeat visits and average ticket size.
   - Offer bonus points for combo purchases to encourage bundling.

3. Upsell & bundling
   - Train POS prompts to suggest bundling (Coffee and Pastry Combo).
   - Introduce limited-time bundle discounts to test lift on premium items.

4. Reposition or trial premium items
   - Test smaller, trial-size offerings or sampling of loose teas and flavors.
   - Consider temporary discounts on premium inventory to increase trial and collect feedback.

5. Targeted promotions by store
   - Run A/B promotions in Astoria to learn what drove the June spike; replicate in other locations as appropriate.
   - Deploy geo-targeted offers for off-peak hours to smooth demand.

6. Inventory & procurement optimization
   - Use morning demand forecasts to adjust inventory (reduce waste, ensure availability of high-sellers).
   - De-prioritize slow-moving SKUs or test repositioning/price changes.

7. Measure & iterate
   - Track KPIs: daily revenue, avg. basket size, items per transaction, conversion rate for upsells, redemption rate for loyalty.
   - Run controlled experiments for offers and measure incremental revenue.
